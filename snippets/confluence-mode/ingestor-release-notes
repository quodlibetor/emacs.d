Release Notes - Services Development - ${1:Ingestor} Library v${2:1}

${3:Jira-generated notes}

h2. Deployment Steps

${4:Updates will be made via yum. No additional update steps are required.}

h2. Anticipated Outage

${5:This is a deploy to lightly used stage. The yum update will complete in seconds, there will be a few seconds where ingestor is nonfunctional, but it should not affect anything--if superfeedr tries to contact us, they'll try again.}

h2. Affected Applications

${6:The following applications depend upon Ingestor:
* Ragu Data Store
* Feed Register

This release should not change the relationship.}
